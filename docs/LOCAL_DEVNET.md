# FlowMemory Local Devnet

Status: runnable no-value local runtime

The local FlowMemory devnet is a Rust CLI that models FlowMemory appchain-style state transitions without production consensus, tokenomics, bridge assets, public validator onboarding, or mainnet claims.

It is local/no-value only. It has no balances, rewards, staking, gas economics, bridge security, or production deployment behavior.

## Framework Decision

The prototype uses a simple custom Rust devnet under `crates/flowmemory-devnet`.

Reason:

- Rust is a better long-term fit for chain/node work than ad hoc scripts.
- The local model needs deterministic state roots, block hashes, and tests.
- A full OP Stack/Base Appchain deployment would be premature before schemas and anchors stabilize.
- Custom consensus is explicitly out of scope.

## Install/Build

From repo root:

```powershell
cargo test --manifest-path crates/flowmemory-devnet/Cargo.toml
```

## Commands

Windows-first root wrappers:

```powershell
npm run flowchain:init
npm run flowchain:start
npm run flowchain:demo
npm run flowchain:export
npm run flowchain:stop
```

The wrappers call the Rust CLI below and write ignored operator/status/handoff/
export files under `devnet/local/`. The current runtime is still a
deterministic local CLI, not a long-running node.

Initialize state:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path crates/flowmemory-devnet/Cargo.toml -- init
```

`init` writes deterministic genesis state plus local boundary files next to the state file:

```text
devnet/local/state.json
devnet/local/genesis-config.json
devnet/local/operator-key-references.json
```

The operator key file is a reference boundary only. It records local fixture identifiers and crypto schema references, but no signing secret material.

Reset local state:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path crates/flowmemory-devnet/Cargo.toml -- reset-local
```

Run the full deterministic demo:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path crates/flowmemory-devnet/Cargo.toml -- demo
```

Inspect summary:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path crates/flowmemory-devnet/Cargo.toml -- inspect-state --summary
```

Submit a transaction fixture:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path crates/flowmemory-devnet/Cargo.toml -- submit-fixture --fixture fixtures/handoff/sample-txs.json
```

Build a block from pending transactions:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path crates/flowmemory-devnet/Cargo.toml -- run-block
```

Run a bounded local block-production loop:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path crates/flowmemory-devnet/Cargo.toml -- start --blocks 3
```

`run --blocks 3` is an alias for `start --blocks 3`.

Run the full smoke flow:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path crates/flowmemory-devnet/Cargo.toml -- smoke
```

Import a FlowPulse observation fixture:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path crates/flowmemory-devnet/Cargo.toml -- submit-fixture --fixture fixtures/handoff/sample-flowpulse-observation.json
cargo run --manifest-path crates/flowmemory-devnet/Cargo.toml -- run-block
```

Import a verifier report fixture:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path crates/flowmemory-devnet/Cargo.toml -- submit-fixture --fixture fixtures/handoff/sample-verifier-report.json
cargo run --manifest-path crates/flowmemory-devnet/Cargo.toml -- run-block
```

Export handoff fixtures:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path crates/flowmemory-devnet/Cargo.toml -- export-fixtures --out-dir fixtures/handoff/generated
```

`export` is an alias for `export-fixtures`.

Export and import a full state snapshot:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path crates/flowmemory-devnet/Cargo.toml -- export-state --out fixtures/handoff/generated/state-snapshot.json
cargo run --manifest-path crates/flowmemory-devnet/Cargo.toml -- --state devnet/local/imported-state.json import-state --from fixtures/handoff/generated/state-snapshot.json
```

Use a custom state path:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path crates/flowmemory-devnet/Cargo.toml -- --state devnet/local/custom-state.json demo
```

## What The Demo Builds

The demo:

1. Starts from deterministic genesis.
2. Initializes local no-value genesis config and operator key references.
3. Registers a rootfield.
4. Registers a model passport.
5. Registers an agent account.
6. Registers a verifier module identity.
7. Submits an artifact commitment.
8. Marks artifact availability with a local proof/status object.
9. Commits a latest root.
10. Submits a work receipt.
11. Submits an accepted verifier report.
12. Updates a memory cell from the accepted receipt.
13. Opens and resolves a challenge.
14. Finalizes the work receipt.
15. Builds block 1.
16. Creates a Base settlement anchor placeholder with deterministic map roots.
17. Builds block 2.
18. Writes state to `devnet/local/state.json`.
19. Exports dashboard, indexer, verifier, control-plane, config, key-reference, and full-state handoff files to `fixtures/handoff/generated/`.

## State Model

The prototype stores:

- `config`
- `operatorKeyReferences`
- `rootfields`
- `agentAccounts`
- `modelPassports`
- `memoryCells`
- `challenges`
- `finalityReceipts`
- `artifactCommitments`
- `artifactAvailabilityProofs`
- `verifierModules`
- `workReceipts`
- `verifierReports`
- `importedObservations`
- `importedVerifierReports`
- `baseAnchors`
- `blocks`
- `pendingTxs`

There are no token balances and no gas accounting.

## Transaction Types

Supported local transactions:

- `RegisterRootfield`
- `RegisterAgent`
- `RegisterModelPassport`
- `CommitRoot`
- `SubmitArtifactCommitment`
- `MarkArtifactAvailability`
- `SubmitWorkReceipt`
- `SubmitVerifierReport`
- `RegisterVerifierModule`
- `UpdateMemoryCell`
- `OpenChallenge`
- `ResolveChallenge`
- `FinalizeWorkReceipt`
- `AnchorBatchToBasePlaceholder`
- `ImportFlowPulseObservation`
- `ImportVerifierReport`

## Local Lifecycle Rules

- Agent and model records are identity/provenance records only; they do not hold balances.
- Work receipts must reference an existing artifact commitment in the same rootfield.
- Verifier reports must reference an existing active verifier module and an existing receipt in the same rootfield.
- Memory cells can be created or updated only from an existing work receipt with an accepted local verifier report.
- A failed, invalid, rejected, unsupported, reorged, missing, or still-unaccepted receipt cannot update memory.
- Challenges can be opened only against existing receipts.
- Finality receipts can be created only for accepted receipts with no unresolved challenge.
- Artifact availability is a local proof/status record over an existing artifact commitment; it does not store raw artifact data.
- Verifier modules are local identity records for verifier provenance; they do not introduce staking, rewards, or verifier economics.

## Blocks And Roots

Each block has:

- Block number.
- Parent hash.
- Logical time.
- Transaction ids.
- Receipts.
- State root.
- Block hash.

The devnet uses deterministic logical time and canonical JSON with Keccak-256. Tests prove the same inputs produce the same state root and block hash.

`inspect-state --summary`, exported handoff files, and Base anchor placeholders include deterministic roots for the local maps, including operator key references, agent accounts, model passports, memory cells, challenges, finality receipts, artifact availability proofs, verifier modules, work receipts, and verifier reports.

## Persistence

Default local state:

```text
devnet/local/state.json
```

`devnet/local/` is ignored by git.

## Handoff Files

Generated exports:

- `fixtures/handoff/generated/dashboard-state.json`
- `fixtures/handoff/generated/indexer-handoff.json`
- `fixtures/handoff/generated/verifier-handoff.json`
- `fixtures/handoff/generated/control-plane-handoff.json`
- `fixtures/handoff/generated/genesis-config.json`
- `fixtures/handoff/generated/operator-key-references.json`
- `fixtures/handoff/generated/state.json`

The generated dashboard, indexer, verifier, and state outputs include the expanded local object maps and deterministic map roots. These are local prototype outputs. Review before committing generated copies.

The control-plane handoff contains the current chain id, latest block, blocks, pending transactions, object maps, deterministic map roots, genesis config, and operator key references. It is intended for local services to consume without reading ignored `devnet/local/` files.

## Non-Goals

- No production consensus.
- No validator set.
- No tokenomics.
- No validator rewards.
- No staking or slashing.
- No mainnet deployment.
- No bridge security claims.
- No live Base settlement.
- No raw AI memory or artifacts on-chain.
- No hardware validator requirements.
